This is a portfolio website that used SASS, VUE, AJAX, database. When it opens the website, it shows landing page with a video hero section and something css animation introduction tagline about me, and fooer. And there are a gallery, about me, and contact pages as well. 
In the gallery page, it used a database with AJAX and also emits each database about information once it clicks the button. Now, it used "this.$emit methods" with vue.js, but I think it needs to try a lightbox for more specific pieces ofinformation including images.
